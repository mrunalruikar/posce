**Posce** (pronounced *poshÂ·eee*) is a note-taking toolkit for your command line. It takes a single directory of plaintext note files and lets you create, edit, manipulate, and organise them to your heart's content.

- See [changes.md][ch] for a complete changelog.
- See [license.md][li] for licensing information.

Installation
------------

Posce required [Python 3.8][py] or higher. To install, you can:

- Run `pip install posce`, or
- Download the [latest release][re].

Configuration
-------------

Posce only requires two environment variables to be set:

~~~bash
# The path to your notes directory.
POSCE_DIR = "~/notes"

# The extension your note files use (no dot).
POSCE_EXT = "txt"
~~~

On macOS and Linux, these variables can be set in your shell profile script, most likely `$HOME/.profile`. On Windows, you can set them in the "Environment Variables" subscreen in System Properties (search "environment" in your Start Menu).

Over three and a half centuries ago,
linked by faith and bound by a common
desire for liberty, a small band of
pilgrims sought out a place in the New
World where they could worship according
to their own beliefs... and solve
crimes.
